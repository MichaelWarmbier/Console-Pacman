# Console-Pacman

 Work on this project has been discontinued.

### Pacman entirely redesigned using C++. 

Being developed by Michael Warmbier with support by Sam Montanaro.

Pacman is the original maze-chase arcade game developed by Bandai Namco and released on May 22, 1980.

###### Game is currently very unnfinished. As a result, build updates are _not_ currently being noted as different alpha versions.

## Description

This version of Pacman is being developed using the standard libraries of C++ and the Windows.h header. Written and compiled in Visual Studio 2019. All credit is shared between both developers.

This project was made with the purpose of practicing turning abstract concepts into concrete code. None of those code was directly ripped or inspired by anything other than the abstract logic of the game. 

## File System

* Executables - Each executable is associated with a different build versions. In order to run an executable and properly play the game, all associated files must be present (including .dlls, the spritesheet and sound files).

* Sounds - All sounds files used in the game.

* Source - All source .cpp/.h files, if any.

* Sprite Sheet - Holds one file, the main sprite sheet used for the game.
